  "summary": "# Persistence Core-1 v11.15.0 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal is to do a software upgrade to the v11.15.0 software tag of the Persistence codebase at [18507000](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/block/18507000) block height. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for precise time.\n\n## Scope of the upgrade\n\nThis proposal suggests an upgrade to the core-1 chain to address two recently reported issues:\n\n1. IBC Timeout Fix:\nAddresses a problem where IBC calls for token swaps sometimes timeout, leading to user tokens being locked in the Skip DEX aggregator contract. This update ensures that IBC calls complete successfully, preventing token locking and fixes the callback hooks thereby releasing the assets back to the users' wallets on failure.\n\n2. Vesting Accounts issue with LSM:\nSome users have identified an issue when attempting to use the LSM to tokenise XPRT. Deeper analysis showed that this is due to how vesting accounts handle staking. Currently, it only updates the delegated vesting and delegated free amounts when you stake or unstake $XPRT. However, these amounts are not adjusted when using the LSM. This creates a problem where, even if your vesting period is complete, it prevents from tokenizing your stake, which will be fixed in this upgrade.\n\n\n## Change log\n\n- Full changelog [here](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/compare/v11.14.0...v11.15.0).\n\n## How to upgrade\n\n[Upgrade using cosmovisor](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/cosmovisor-upgrades)\n[Upgrade manually](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/manual-upgrades)\n\n## Communications\n\nOperators are encouraged to join the `#validators-discussion` channel of the Persistence Community Discord. This channel is the primary communication tool for operators to ask questions, report upgrade status, report technical issues, and build social consensus should the need arise. If you don't have access, please contact someone from the Persistence team directly.\n"
