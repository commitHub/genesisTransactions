Enable the `Rate Sync` module on the chain to facilitate integrations for stkAssets.\n3. Update the `LiquidStakeIBC` module with improved automatic updates of the security bounds for the c-value.\n4. Enable the Timeweave integration.\n\n## Change log\n- Full changelog [here](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/compare/v10.4.1...v11.8.1).\n\n### New Modules\n* `x/ratesync`\n* `x/liquidstake`\n\n## How to upgrade\n[Upgrade using cosmovisor](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/cosmovisor-upgrades)\n\n[Upgrade manually](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/manual-upgrades)\n\n## Communications\nOperators are encouraged to join the #validators-discussion channel of the Persistence Community Discord.
