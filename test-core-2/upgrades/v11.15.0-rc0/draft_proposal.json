  "summary": "# Persistence test-core-2 v11.15.0-rc0 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal is to do a software upgrade to the v11.15.0-rc0 software tag of the Persistence codebase at [7312000](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence-testnet/block/7312000) block height. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for precise time.\n\n## Scope of the upgrade\n\n1. Vesting Account Update:\n\nWe've identified an issue with how vesting accounts handle staking. Currently, it only updates the delegated vesting and delegated free amounts when you stake or unstake $XPRT. However, these amounts are not adjusted when using the LSM.\n\nThis creates a problem where, even if your vesting period is complete, it prevents from tokenizing your stake. While there are workarounds, this behavior isn't ideal, and this upgrade fixes it. \n\n2. IBC Timeout Fix:\n\nAddresses a problem where IBC calls for token swaps sometimes timeout, leading to user tokens being locked in the Skip DEX aggregator contract. This update ensures that IBC calls complete successfully, preventing token locking and fixes the callback hooks thereby releasing the assets back to the users' wallets on failure. \n\n## Change log\n\n- Full changelog [here](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/compare/v11.13.0-rc0...v11.15.0-rc0).\n\n## How to upgrade\n\n[Upgrade using cosmovisor](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/cosmovisor-upgrades)\n[Upgrade manually](https://docs.persistence.one/build/nodes-and-endpoints/node-operations/manual-upgrades)\n\n## Communications\n\nOperators are encouraged to join the `#validators-discussion` channel of the Persistence Community Discord. This channel is the primary communication tool for operators to ask questions, report upgrade status, report technical issues, and build social consensus should the need arise. If you donâ€™t have access, please contact someone from the Persistence team directly.\n"
